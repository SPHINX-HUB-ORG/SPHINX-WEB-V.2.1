     * of the key is the value provided by the query
     * ```graphql
     * {
     *   getPostsList(filter: {
     *     title: {
     *       eq: "Hello, World"

     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     * Would equate to a query string of:
     * ```
     * __attribute__#posts#posts#title#Hello, World
     * ```
     * This can be used by a data store as a secondary index of sorts
     *
     * It's important to note that for now each query string acts as an "AND" clause,
     * meaning the resulting records need to be present in _each_ query string.
     *
     * @param hydrator
     * hydrator is an optional callback, which may be useful depending on the storage mechanism.
     * For example, the in-memory storage only stores the path to its records as its value,
     * but in something like DynamoDB the query strings may be used to look up the full record,
     * meaning there's no need to "hydrate" the return value
