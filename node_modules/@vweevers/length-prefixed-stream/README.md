# length-prefixed-stream

**Streaming equivalent of [`length-prefixed-message`](https://github.com/sorribas/length-prefixed-message). This module allow you to send Buffers with a varint length prefix to ensure that they will arrive unpartioned.** A fork of [`mafintosh/length-prefixed-stream`](https://github.com/mafintosh/length-prefixed-stream) (2.0.0) that upgraded `readable-stream` from 3 to 4.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm i @vweevers/length-prefixed-stream
```

## Usage

```js
const lpstream = require('@vweevers/length-prefixed-stream')

const encode = lpstream.encode() // create an encode stream to send data
const decode = lpstream.decode() // create an decode stream to receive data

encode.write('hello world') // send "hello world"

decode.on('data', function(data) {
  console.log(data.toString()) // will always print "hello world"
})

encode.pipe(decode) // for testing just pipe to our selves
```

## Encoding format

This library encodes each chunks as follows:

```
<length-of-chunk-1> <chunk-1> <length-of-chunk-2> <chunk-2> â€¦
```

The length of the following chunk is encoded using [`varint`](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/varint#readme), which follows the [protobuf-style varint encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints).

As an example, we're going to encode two ASCII chunks:

```
1st chunk:
68 65 79                            hey
2nd chunk:
68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64    hello world
```

Encoded using `length-prefixed-stream`, they look like this:

```
03                                  varint-encoded length of 1st chunk
68 65 79                            1st chunk (3 bytes)
0b                                  varint-encoded length ()of 2nd chunk
68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64    2nd chunk (11 bytes)
```
